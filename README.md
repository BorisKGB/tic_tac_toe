# tic_tac_toe

## Idea

Create simple tic tac toe game that you can play with robot, yourself, or just watch two robots playing.

## Realisation idea


Draw a table in the console and wait for input from the player in format like:

```
  | a | b | c 
1 |   |   |   
2 |   | x | x 
3 |   |   | o 
--------------
Please write coordinate to put 'o' > a2
```

## Limitations

1. Use only Console to interact with user
2. Do not use or peek into third-party solutions, unless i'm stuck
3. Do not use or make any external libraries
